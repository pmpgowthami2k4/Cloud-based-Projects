By leveraging multiple AWS services such as S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight, the project creates an end-to-end data pipeline that automates the process of data ingestion, transformation, querying, and visualization.

The workflow begins with raw data being uploaded to an S3 bucket (Staging layer). Using AWS Glue, the data is extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) into a Data Warehouse layer in S3. A Glue Crawler is then used to automatically catalog the data for querying. AWS Athena allows the cataloged data to be queried using SQL. Finally, the insights generated from Athena queries are visualized in Amazon QuickSight, providing interactive dashboards and reports for better understanding and analysis of the Spotify data.

This approach ensures a highly scalable and cost-effective solution that is easy to maintain and extend, providing actionable insights from the data.
