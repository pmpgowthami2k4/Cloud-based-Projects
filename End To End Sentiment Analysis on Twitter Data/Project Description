1. 1 Problem Statement:
In todayâ€™s digital age, sentiment analysis is essential for understanding public opinions and emotions on social media platforms like Twitter. This project aims to perform an end-to-end sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets, utilizing both Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
The project is divided into two parts. The first part involves setting up Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Google Colab for automated tweet analysis. The GCP setup includes enabling Google Sheets and Drive APIs and creating a service account to access the data. A Google Colab notebook is used to read tweets from a Google Sheet, perform sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) model, and automatically update the sentiment results in the same Google Sheet. This setup automates the process of collecting, analyzing, and updating sentiment data in real time.
The second part of the project leverages AWS to handle large-scale data processing and visualization. The tweet data is stored in Amazon S3, and AWS Glue is used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to set up the data pipeline. AWS Athena is employed for querying the processed data, and AWS QuickSight is used to visualize the sentiment analysis results in a user-friendly format. This combination of GCP for real-time data automation and AWS for scalable processing delivers a robust and efficient solution for sentiment analysis, supporting applications like market research, customer feedback, and social media monitoring.


1.2 Objectives of the Project:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a scalable, automated big data pipeline to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using both Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). This project aims to efficiently process large volumes of raw Twitter sentiment data and transform it into meaningful insights for decision-making.
